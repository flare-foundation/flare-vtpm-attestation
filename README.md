# Flare vTPM Attestation

Flare vTPM Attestation is a Solidity-based implementation designed to verify Virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) quotes generated within Google Cloud Platformâ€™s (GCP) Confidential Space. 
This solution enables the permissionless onboarding of multiple Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) on Flare, establishing a verifiable chain of trust across the network.

Verification cost: Approx. 2M gas

## Requirements

- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org) v0.8.27 or higher
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (for example scripts)

## Usage

Start by cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dineshpinto/flare-vtpm-attestation
```

To compile the contracts, run:

```bash
forge build
```

To run the contract tests:

```bash
forge test -vv
```

- The `-vv` flag provides verbose output, useful for detailed test logging.
- To generate a gas report for the contract functions, use the `--gas-report` flag.

### Deploying the contracts

To deploy the contracts, you can use a Foundry script along with your preferred RPC URL and private key:

```bash
forge script script/FlareVtpmAttestation.s.sol:FlareVtpmAttestationScript --rpc-url ${FLARE_RPC_URL} --private-key ${DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY}
```

To maintain code consistency and adhere to Solidity style guidelines, format the code with:

```bash
forge fmt
```

# Python

The example logic is already written out in Python. To run it:

```bash
cd py/
uv sync --all-extras
```

Example attestation tokens are stored in `py/data/`, to test them:

```bash
uv run pki_attestation_validation.py
uv run oidc_attestation_validation.py
```

Note these actual validation may fail as the attestation tokens may be outdated.
