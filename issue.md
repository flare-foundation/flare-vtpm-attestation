To mitigate the impact of any potential bugs or exploits discovered after deployment, the contract should include an emergency stop mechanism.

Suggested path:
Inherit from OpenZeppelin's widely-used Pausable contract to make core functions pausable by the contract owner.

Acceptance Criteria:

- FlareVtpmAttestation.sol inherits from Pausable.sol.
- The whenNotPaused modifier is applied to all state-changing public/external functions, especially verifyAndAttest and setBaseQuoteConfig (or setPolicy).
- The owner has access to the pause() and unpause() functions.
- Tests are added to ensure that functions are blocked when the contract is paused and functional when unpaused.
